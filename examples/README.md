## Simple Examples

### [Conway's Game of Life](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/gol/)
[![Conway's Game of Life](./gol/main.png)](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/gol/)
This is a WebGL fragment shader implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.

### [Julia Set Fractal](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/fractal/)
[![Julia Set Fractal](./fractal/main.png)](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/fractal/)
This app renders 2D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia set</a> fractals for a variety of input parameters.

## Grid-Based Systems

### [Reaction Diffusion](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/reaction-diffusion/)
[![Reaction Diffusion](./reaction-diffusion/main.png)](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/reaction-diffusion/)
This app simulates a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system">reaction-diffusion system</a>, where two virtual chemicals interact to create dynamic patterns.  Similar systems were proposed by <a href="https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf">Alan Turing in 1952</a> as a mechanism for pattern formation in plants and animals.  This reaction-diffusion system is particularly sensitive to two parameters: K (varies along x-axis) and F (varies along y-axis).  You can interactively explore regions of K,F parameter space by zooming and panning across the screen.

## Particle + Grid Systems

### [Physarum Transport Network](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/physarum/)
[![Physarum Transport Network](./physarum/main.png)](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/physarum/)
This app simulates the network effects of a multicellular slime mold (Physarum polycephalum), based on a 2010 paper by Jeff Jones: <a href="https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579">"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of Physarum transport networks"</a> and work by <a href="https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum">Sage Jenson</a>.  In this simulation, particle "agents" interact with an underlying field of chemical attractants to form complex, emergent behaviors.

### [Fluid Simulation](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/fluid/)
[![Fluid Simulation](./fluid/main.png)](https://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/examples/fluid/)
This simulation solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a> for incompressible fluids. The fluid visualization includes thousands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_particle_tracking">Lagrangian particles</a> that follow the velocity field and leave behind semi-transparent trails as they move.
