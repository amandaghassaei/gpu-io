# Tests

## Automated Testing

I'm using mocha + karma + chai + headless Chrome to test the components of this library, following the setup described in [Automated testing with Headless Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/headless-karma-mocha-chai/).  Those tests are located in [tests/mocha/](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/gpu-io/blob/main/tests/mocha/).  To run the automated tests, use:

```
npm run test
```

## Browser Testing

I've also included an html page (at [tests/index.html](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/gpu-io/blob/main/tests/index.html)) for testing various functions of this library in a browser/hardware combo of your choice.  This page is current hosted at [apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/tests/](http://apps.amandaghassaei.com/gpu-io/tests/).

Note: The detected OS and browser version may not always be 100% accurate.


## Browser Support

Here are some results I've gathered testing different combinations of hardware/browsers.  All tests are passing, but some combinations require a fragment shader polyfill (indicated by a `*`) to achieve the desired WRAP/FILTER combination, and others fall back on data types that do not fully cover the range of values expected in the desired type (e.g. using FLOAT types instead of INT types, FLOAT only covers integers in the range [-16,777,216, 16,777,216.], while INT covers the range [-2,147,483,648, 2,147,483,647]).
